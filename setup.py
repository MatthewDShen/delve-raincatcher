Raincatcher lets property managers, architects, and planners see how their sites handle storms. First, small scale flood simulations are conducted based on your site's properties. Raincatcher then lets you see how nature based solutions like rain gardens and green roofs improve your properties ability to resist flooding. Finally, raincatcher provides the user data to make an informed decision on how they best build their site.',
